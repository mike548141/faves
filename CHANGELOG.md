# Changelog

Notable changes to Faves, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This is a
curated site, not a released package, so there are no version tags yet —
everything sits under _Unreleased_ until the first public launch.
Per-restaurant "verified on" dates in the menu data track content
freshness separately from this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- "Near me" distance sort (roadmap Theme 2): a home-screen toggle that
  uses the device location (`navigator.geolocation`) + haversine to sort
  venues nearest-first, showing each one's distance ("1.2 km") on its
  card. No tile map, no map library, no external request — offline-safe
  and zero-dependency; declining the location permission just keeps the
  usual order. Pure logic in `site/js/distance.js` with unit tests.
- Native maps handoff (roadmap Theme 2): tapping a venue's address on the
  menu screen now opens the device's own maps app — Apple Maps on
  iOS/macOS, the default maps app via a `geo:` link on Android, Google
  Maps on desktop — at exact coordinates. Added `lat`/`lng` (WGS84) to
  every venue in the schema, geocoded from their addresses, with
  validation and unit tests (`site/js/geo.js`).
- "Pick for us" (Phase 4): a shuffle over the filtered set that lands on
  one place with a deep link; instant under reduced-motion.
- Offline PWA (Phase 5): service worker precaches the app shell and all
  menus; network-first data, cache-first shell, capped image cache.
- Share/SEO polish (Phase 6): Open Graph + Twitter card + canonical meta
  on both screens, and a 1200×630 share image.
- Development conventions adopted from the `ros`/`tiki` repos: decision
  records under `docs/decisions/`, an append-only `docs/SESSIONS.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and this changelog.
- JS unit tests for the pure filter logic (`node --test`), run in CI
  alongside menu-data validation.
- Zero-dependency guard (`tools/check_no_deps.py`, a CI job) enforcing
  the no-third-party-components invariant from ADR 0001.

### Changed
- Corrected the `CLAUDE.md` zero-build wording: Node may be used for dev
  tooling (Lighthouse, tests) but is never a build or runtime dependency;
  the site still ships build-less.

### Fixed
- Dark-mode colour contrast on the "Call to order" label (WCAG 2.2 AA),
  bringing the menu screen to Lighthouse Accessibility 100.
