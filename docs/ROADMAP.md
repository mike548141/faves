# Roadmap (post-launch / vNext)

The current work plan (Phases 0–7 in `WORKPLAN.md`) takes us to a
launched, installable, offline menu browser. This is what comes **after**
— the owner's roadmap brain-dump, grouped into themes, sequenced, and
checked against the hard constraints (zero-build, offline, static, no
backend, no accounts, no personal data in the repo). Nothing here changes
v1 scope.

**Legend.** Effort **S/M/L**. Tags: `[schema]` needs a data-model change
(record in `ARCHITECTURE.md` when built); `[design]` needs a design call;
`[constraint]` sits in tension with a hard constraint or non-goal —
resolution noted inline; **⚑** a decision only the owner can make.

**On "no backend" (owner steer, 2026-07-09; updated 2026-07-23).** The
stance softened from *never* to *not yet*: a lightweight backend (e.g. a
Cloudflare Worker) is an acceptable **future** direction — live
group-order rooms, feedback intake — but adopting one is a deliberate
step that needs its own ADR first ([ADR 0009] records the steer).
**Now gated open for sync:** [ADR 0017] adopts a Cloudflare Worker + KV
for cross-device sync and formally softens the non-goal — a *serverless
backend is permitted*; *accounts are deliberately not adopted* (a bearer
sync-code carries it); off-device data *must* be end-to-end encrypted.
Other backend-gated items (live rooms, feedback intake, the Google-rating
edge proxy) revisit against that precedent — each still its own ADR.

---

## Theme 1 — From *decided* to *ordered*: the Order tally ★ flagship

> ✅ **Shipped 2026-07-08** — the Order tally (Job 3): a local, offline
> `cart.js` model, venue-grouped order sheet, subtotals + estimated total,
> collect mode. Design record + v1 deferrals → [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).

## Theme 1b — Group ordering: send your picks to the orderer

> ✅ **Shipped 2026-07-10, fully closed** — group ordering on a versioned
> URL-fragment codec (send / copy / **QR fallback** + receive-with-confirm
> merge), reused for shareable shortlists. Only acceptance left: a real
> phone-camera scan (owner). Record + ADR 0009 → [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).

## Theme 2 — Location & maps

✅ **Shipped 2026-07-08** — availability + favourite ranking (`ranking.js`) and
its tunable distance dials; schema coordinates, native-maps handoff (ADR 0005),
and the "📍 Near me" distance-sorted list. A real tile-map view was ruled out on
the offline/no-CDN constraint. Detail → [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).

**Now all shipped** — three route/reachability items landed 2026-07-22/23;
verbatim design records → [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).

- ✅ **Pick along a route** `[L][constraint]` — **shipped 2026-07-23** (ADR
  0014): offline least-detour sort (`site/js/route.js`) + routed maps handoff
  (`geo.routeMapsUrlFor`); suburb-centroid or specific-place destination, no
  geocoder, no stored address. Live routed corridor stays ✗ (keyed/paid API).
  Detail → [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).
- ✅ **Drive time from me to a venue** `[M]` — **shipped 2026-07-22** (ADR
  0010): driving-directions maps handoff + a "~N min drive" haversine hint on
  Near-me cards. Live in-app routed time stays ✗. Detail →
  [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).
- ✅ **Restaurants with multiple locations** `[M][schema]` — **shipped
  2026-07-22** (ADR 0011, `site/js/locations.js`): optional per-venue
  `locations[]`, nearest-branch resolution across Near-me/drive-time/open-badge/
  maps-handoff. Detail → [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).
  **Still open:** Kaffee Eis + Gong Cha's **second branches** — need real
  addresses + a dev-time geocode; a content session appends them, no code change.

- ✅ **Choose your maps app** `[S]` — **shipped 2026-07-23** (ADR 0018). The web
  can't read the OS default-maps-app, so Settings → "Maps app" lets the viewer
  pick Apple / Google / Waze / "Match my device" (default = platform detection).
  `geo.resolveMapsTarget` + a Waze provider; per-profile like other settings.

**Open:**

- [ ] **"Along a route" → free-text destination + unified search bar**
  `[L][constraint][owner-ratified 2026-07-23]` — owner: the suburb/place
  **dropdown** (ADR 0014) is too limiting; wants to **type any address/area**,
  and to **fold it into the restaurants-page search bar** (type a dish/restaurant
  → results; type a place → "on the way to there"). Free text → coordinates needs
  a **geocoder = an external request**, which relaxes the offline/zero-dependency
  invariant (ADR 0001) — the exact wall ADR 0014 cited. **Owner has ratified
  crossing it** for destination entry (online-only; rest of site stays offline).
  Chosen: **Nominatim/OSM** (no key, attribution + usage-policy compliance),
  behind graceful offline degradation. **Deferred to a focused next session** —
  it's a new external **trust surface**: needs its own ADR (relax the invariant +
  provider choice), a **CSP `connect-src`** allowance, the geocode module, the
  search-bar intent detection, and re-wiring `route.js` off the dropdown. Build
  order + security notes to live in that ADR.
- **Travel time next to the address / hours (mode-aware)** `[M]` — owner steer
  2026-07-23, raw: *"keep the feature idea in the roadmap, refine that idea that
  I want the travel time (not necessarily drive e.g. I'm 100m walk away) shown in
  Faves next to the address/opening hours or maybe in the collect window/dialog"*.
  Refined honestly: a **mode-aware in-app estimate** — walk when you're close,
  drive when you're far (the crossover distance is a design call) — surfaced on
  the **menu screen near the address/hours row** and/or in the **collect
  dialog**, not only on the Near-me home card as today. Builds on the existing
  haversine distance + `estimateDriveMinutes()` (ADR 0010 part b); add a walk
  estimate (a slower km/h, no road-winding padding) and pick the mode by
  distance. Stays a `~` approximation — **no routing API** (that's the
  offline/zero-dep wall, unchanged). Needs the viewer's location, so it only
  shows when Near-me has captured an origin this session (`recallOrigin`).

**Parked idea** (from ADR 0014 consequences): a **"surprise me on the way"**
variant of the Pick-for-us shuffle that draws from the along-route pool rather
than the Near-me pool — parked, unclaimed, `[S/M]`.

## Owner rulings — 2026-07-23 (session Q&A, raw where quoted)

- ✅ **"Nearest first" goes pure distance** — **applied 2026-07-23** (`9a4ed78`,
  wt: faves-wave8-rulings-apply). `ranking.js` origin branch now leads on raw
  distance → availability tiebreak → curated; a hearted venue keeps its ♥ badge
  but earns no distance pull, so a nearer plain venue always outranks a farther
  hearted one (regression test: hearted 10 km vs plain 2.5 km → 2.5 km wins).
  Default no-location order unchanged (a heart still floats via the favTie
  tiebreak). ⚠️ Side effect: the `favBoostKm` settings dial is now inert for
  ordering — queued follow-on: **repurpose or retire the favBoostKm dial** `[S]`.
  (Closes the ⚠️ open question under the sort-bug record below.)
- ✅ **Language stays per-profile** — owner ratified the ADR 0012 scoping as
  shipped. No change.
- ✅ **Ratings UX rework** `[M][design]` — **shipped 2026-07-23** (ADR 0019,
  supersedes ADR 0013's scale + control shape). Owner reviewed the live 1–3
  three-button control: read ambiguously, took too much room, and sat
  confusingly beside the ♥. Reworked to a **1–5 star tap/drag slider**
  (`role="slider"`, full keyboard, ~140px one-target), moved to its own line
  **under the dish/venue name**, clear of the heart. `validate.py` curated range
  1..3 → 1..5; old stored marks stay valid (no migration); curated field still
  dormant. Browser-verified at 390px. The (a)+(b)-not-public shape stands.
- ✅ **Directions handoff — backed out to a pin** — **applied 2026-07-23**
  (`9dad5f8`, ADR 0016, wt: faves-wave8-rulings-apply). Owner, raw: "I don't
  think this meets what I wanted for the feature. We need to review it and may
  back out the change. Also when I tapped on 'R & S Satay Noodle House' which is
  shown at the pickup address '148 Cuba St' the maps open on '1 Garrett St'."
  Applied: the address tap now opens a map **pin** (not directions), targeting
  the **street address string** — `apple maps.apple.com/?q=<addr>`, `google
  maps/search/?api=1&query=<addr>` — so Maps geocodes 148 Cuba St exactly. Coords
  are a belt-and-braces fallback only (they stay the source for in-app distance
  maths). The along-route "🧭 Route via maps" handoff keeps its routed form but
  its venue leg targets the address too. ADR 0010 part (a) superseded; its "~N
  min drive" hint (b) stands. The underlying coord imprecision is still open —
  see the **Coordinate audit** `[S]` below.
- [ ] **Coordinate audit** `[S]` — follow-on: dev-time geocoded coords are
  suspect fleet-wide (R & S proven ~100 m off). Sweep all venue coords against
  their street addresses; affects distance sort + detour maths accuracy.

## Owner-reported — 2026-07-22

Both resolved; verbatim raw-note records → [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).

- ✅ **Bug: "Nearest first" sorts 10 km above 2.5 km** — **fixed 2026-07-22**
  (`566aa20`). Root cause was not a text sort: the sort-key order put
  availability + the favourite boost ahead of distance; the fix makes distance
  lead when "Nearest first" is on. Detail → [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).
  ⚠️ Hearts-in-Nearest-first question: **ruled + applied 2026-07-23** (pure
  distance, `9a4ed78`) — see Owner rulings above.
- ✅ **Split versioning: app vs config vs data** `[M]` — **shipped 2026-07-23**
  (ADR 0015): `sw.js` split into `SHELL_VERSION` + `DATA_VERSION`, each its own
  cache, so a data-only menu edit refetches just `site/data/*` and no longer
  re-downloads the shell. Runtime upgrade behaviour needs a device pass (steps
  in ADR 0015). Detail → [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).

## Theme 3 — UX & design pass

> ✅ **Shipped 2026-07-08 → 12** — the design pass + both owner test-drive
> rounds: two-column info aside, wayfinding, overflow menu, favourites nesting,
> caveat/allergen ⓘ disclosures, sticky + global search, footer/About surface,
> contact-bar collapse, back-to-top, settings polish, "Share this app". Record →
> [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).
>
> **Still open (small):** self-hosted per-platform **order-online logos**
> (offline / no-hotlink). ✅ **Cook-at-Home top-right grid position — shipped
> 2026-07-22** (`.card-grid .card-recipes` in `site/css/app.css`): detail →
> [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).

## Theme 4 — Content growth (ongoing, in parallel)

- **More favourite restaurants.** The master list lives *outside* the
  repo — a paper list with the menus/recipe books, an Apple Note, or a
  photo in the library. Those aren't reachable from here; the fast path
  is the existing `intake/` pipeline: drop photos/screenshots/Notes
  exports into `intake/`, and they get transcribed to schema (prices from
  paper/in-store, **never** delivery apps).
- **More dishes & home recipes** — same pipeline; the placeholder recipes
  in `cook-at-home.json` get replaced from the Notes export.
- **Dish photos** `[L][schema]` — ✅ rendering shipped 2026-07-08 (self-hosted
  `image`/`alt`, SW-cached, no layout shift); now purely a sourcing task (drop
  owner photos into `intake/`). Render detail → [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).

## Theme 4b — Meals vs dishes: pairings & "goes with"

Owner idea (2026-07-08): Cook-at-Home (and menus) are flat lists of
individual dishes, but people eat *meals*. Two shapes, not exclusive:

- **(b) Recommended pairings** `[M][schema]` — ✅ done 2026-07-08 (ADR 0007):
  optional `goesWith` → "Goes well with …" chips. Detail →
  [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).

- **(a) Reorganise around meals** `[L][schema][design]` — a `meal` becomes
  a first-class set (main + sides + dessert); Cook-at-Home sections become
  curated meals rather than dish categories. More expressive but a bigger
  reorg of the data + UI, and it hard-codes one grouping. Better *after*
  (b) exists, if flat-list-plus-pairings proves too loose.

Recommend **(b) now** (small, reversible, reusable), **(a) later** only if
needed. Both **⚑** need the owner to confirm the direction before schema
lands.

## Theme 4c — User contributions (request a place, report an update)

⚑ **Parked (owner, 2026-07-08): no email — deploy first.** A public front door to
the `intake/` pipeline (suggest a place / report a change). When revisited, the
honest candidates within the constraints: **GitHub Issues** (pre-filled
`issues/new` to a public `faves-feedback` repo) or a **Cloudflare Pages form + edge
function** (R2 photo uploads, adds serverless + a spam guard); third-party forms
stay ✗-by-default. Full pre-decision analysis → [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).

## Theme 5 — Richer dish data

✅ **Shipped 2026-07-08 → 09** — price-per-person + cheap-eats filter (`price.js`,
curated `priceBand` override), dish order-codes, the extended allergen
**vocabulary** (populating stays an `intake/` content task — no tag = not stated),
device-local dietary/allergen preferences with load-bearing safety framing, and
hearted favourites (`favourites.js` + shared `store.js`). Popular/busy times ruled
out (no official API). Detail → [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).

**Still open:**

- **Personal tag overrides (local)** `[M]` — owner idea (2026-07-08): let a
  user **add / edit / remove tags on a venue or dish for themselves** (e.g.
  tag Sprig + Fern as a "coffee" place), stored **locally** — our curated
  tags stay the source of truth in the repo; the user's overlay lives in
  `localStorage` (same personal layer as favourites/order). The home
  filters + search would fold in the user's tags too. Design calls: keep
  user tags visually distinct from ours (they're personal, unverified), and
  a clean merge model (add-to / hide ours?). A natural feeder for Theme 4c
  (a good personal tag could be *suggested* back via the report link). Bigger
  than favourites — an editing UI + a tag store + merge into filter/search.
- **Nutritional info** `[L][constraint-data]` — small suburban venues
  rarely publish reliable nutrition, and inventing it is both dishonest
  and a health-claim risk. Realistic path: compute it only where we own
  the recipe (Cook-at-Home) or the venue supplies it. Don't fake
  restaurant nutrition. Feeds Theme 6.
- ✅ **Ratings / feedback** `[M]` **⚑ shipped, direction awaits owner
  ratification** (shipped 2026-07-22, wt: faves-wave4-local-ratings; ADR 0013) —
  built the recorded recommendation **(a)+(b), not public**: (b) **local-only
  personal ratings** in full — a keyboard-operable ☆☆☆ 1–3 control on venues +
  dishes, per-profile in `localStorage` (`faves.ratings.v1`), styled distinctly
  from our curation; (a) **curated household rating** as **schema + render only**
  — an optional integer `rating: 1..3` on venues/menu items (`validate.py`
  enforced), rendered where picks render, **no data invented** so it ships
  dormant. Public crowd ratings **stay rejected** (backend + moderation +
  accounts break three non-goals). **⚑ still stands:** the owner must ratify the
  (a)+(b)-not-public direction *and* supply the curated `rating` values before
  (a) shows anything. The live-Google-rating edge function below is a **separate,
  owner-gated** item (billing) — out of scope for this change.
- **See public ratings / reviews** `[M]` ⚑ **owner decided 2026-07-08:
  show the number when online, link-out when offline.** The honest read: a
  static site can't fetch a live Google rating (the Places API is keyed,
  billed, and its ToS govern display + caching; a public site can't hold the
  key safely). So the shape is a **progressive enhancement**: a small
  **Cloudflare Pages Function** proxies the key, fetches the rating on demand,
  caches it at the edge, and shows it inline with "powered by Google"
  attribution; **offline or on failure it degrades to a "See reviews"
  link-out** to the venue's Maps listing. This is the *first* external service
  in an otherwise zero-third-party app — the shipped `site/` artifact stays
  zero-dep (the fetch is runtime + optional), but the deployed *system* gains
  one billed online dependency. **Write an ADR when built; sequenced after the
  Cloudflare Pages deploy (Phase 7).** Dish-level ratings stay curated (Google
  rates places, not dishes).

- ✅ **Multiple people's favourites — device-local profiles** `[M]` (shipped
  2026-07-22, wt: faves-wave3-local-profiles; ADR 0012) — several people share
  one phone, each with their own hearts. A "who's using Faves?" switcher in
  Settings (add/rename/delete, first names only); favourites + all of settings
  (dietary/allergen prefs, ranking dials, reo language) are per-profile via a
  registry + profile-scoped storage wrapper; the order tally + Near-me origin
  stay device-shared. Existing data migrates into the default profile. Switching
  visibly re-applies the person's allergen filter (menu/recipe reload on a
  cross-tab switch) so no one browses under someone else's safety settings.
  ~~**Cross-device sync stays out of scope**~~ — **superseded 2026-07-23 by
  [ADR 0017] / Theme 9 below.** The original stance (sync needs an account +
  backend → belongs to a separate signed-in app) was half wrong: continual sync
  is reachable *without* accounts, via a bearer sync-code + an E2E-encrypted
  Worker+KV blob. The health app (Theme 6) stays its own project for
  personal/health data; it simply no longer owns "identity/sync" as its reason.

## Theme 6 — North star: the health tie-in

Treat this as a **separate, private, personal app that *consumes* Faves**
— not a feature bolted into Faves. Why the split is the right
architecture:

- Faves is public, account-free, and forbids personal/health data in the
  repo. An eating diary + exercise log is inherently personal, private
  and persistent — the opposite shape. Mixing them would drag exactly the
  data this repo bans into a public artifact.
- Clean seam: Faves *publishes* structured dish data (portions, tags,
  nutrition where known); a downstream personal app *logs* what was eaten
  against it. **The order tally (Theme 1) is the natural bridge** — an
  order history is the seed of an eating diary.
- Keep the boundary absolute: nothing personal enters this repo. The
  health app is its own project (local-first, private store) that reads
  Faves' JSON.

This stays a *direction*, not a phase — but Themes 1 and 5 are the hooks
that make it possible later, so building them "leaning the right way"
costs nothing now.

## Theme 7 — Provenance & supply-chain: the verifiable zero-dependency claim

Faves' defining property is that the shipped artifact has **no
third-party components** (ADR [0001](decisions/0001-zero-build-vanilla.md)):
no npm packages, no CDN, no framework. This theme makes that claim
*checkable* rather than merely stated. Note the honest framing: for a
zero-dependency site an SBOM is **not** vulnerability management (there's
nothing third-party to scan) — its value is attestation + a tripwire
against dependency creep.

✅ **Shipped** — **SBOM publishing** (2026-07-09, ADR 0008: deterministic
CycloneDX at `/.well-known/sbom.json`, `gen_sbom.py --check` CI gate) and the
**zero-dependency CI guard** (2026-07-08, `check_no_deps.py`). Detail →
[`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](ROADMAP-DONE.md).

**Still open:**

- **`security.txt` + provenance metadata** `[S]` — a `/.well-known/
  security.txt` (contact + policy) is cheap good-citizenship for a public
  site. Build provenance/attestation (SLSA-style) is **N/A today** —
  Cloudflare Pages serves static files with no build to attest; revisit
  only if a real pipeline ever appears.

## Theme 8 — Making the repo public (parked; owner-gated)

Assessed 2026-07-12: publishable, but sequenced. Flipping visibility is a
floor action (one-way door — forks/copies survive any later unpublish) and
stays the owner's explicit call. Order matters:

1. **GitHub PAT refresh first** (already queued estate-side). The session
   log (`docs/SESSIONS.md`, 2026-07-12 deploy entry) records the current
   PAT as classic + broad and lists unhardened credential roots
   (AWS/Google/TrueNAS); git history preserves that line forever, so the
   fix is making it *historical* — refresh the credential, don't redact
   the log.
2. **Branch protection before visibility** — a push to `main` is a deploy;
   public means drive-by PRs/issues. Require review, restrict push.
3. **Owner confirms the docs' family texture.** The 2026-07-06 approval
   covered recipe attributions in site data; the docs also use family
   first names in feature examples and acceptance notes (ROADMAP Themes
   1/1b, SESSIONS). Same first-names-only level, but publishing extends
   the approval from the site to the workshop notes — confirm or trim.

Verified clean 2026-07-12 (tree + full history): no secrets (the one
token line reads from Keychain; "share tokens" are client-side codec),
Apache 2.0 licence present, only `mike@cxi.nz` in commit metadata,
home-area inference no worse than the live site already allows.

## Theme 9 — Cross-device preference sync (owner-approved 2026-07-23)

The same person's hearts, ratings, and settings, kept together across
their own devices. Full deliberation → [ADR 0017]; this is the sequenced
build view. Ethos updated with the owner: a **serverless backend is now
permitted**; **accounts are not** (a bearer sync-code carries it);
**off-device data must be E2E-encrypted** — no way for Cloudflare *or*
the owner to read it.

- **v1 — shareable-link seed** `[S]` — reuse the `share-codec.js` +
  `favourites.merge()` machinery (already built for group-order / shortlist
  links) to encode hearts+settings into a link/QR you open on a second
  device to seed it. **No infra, offline, ship-ready.** Manual one-shot
  transfer, not sync — the honest ceiling for a pure static site, and the
  foundation v2 builds on. **Agreed to ship as "cross-device" v1.**
- **v2 — continual sync (Cloudflare Worker + KV)** `[M][constraint]` ⚑ —
  a tiny Worker holds **one E2E-encrypted blob per user** in Workers KV.
  Design (all in ADR 0017):
  - **Continual bidirectional**, not a one-off migrate: each device keeps
    its offline-first local copy, pushes a **debounced** write (batch a
    flurry of changes into one write on a **5–30 s** idle/blur window —
    never per-tap; writes are the one scarce KV resource), pulls + **merges
    client-side** on open/foreground. KV blob = shared mirror, not source
    of record.
  - **Claim is pluggable over the one E2E store** (addendum, ADR 0017):
    **passkey + WebAuthn PRF** is the headline path — the passkey is the
    claim *and* PRF derives the E2E key on-device (server never sees it),
    platform-synced via **iCloud Keychain** / Google Password Manager, so it
    rides the user's existing Apple/Google with **no OAuth app, no Apple
    Developer fee, no email/PII**. Verified Q1 2026: Safari 18+/Chrome/Android
    ✅, Firefox ✗. The **bearer sync-code** (machine-generated ~44-bit word-code,
    QR *or* words) stays the **universal fallback** for Firefox / non-passkey /
    "just give me a code". OIDC "Sign in with Google/Apple" rejected — it
    claims but supplies no E2E key. No traditional accounts either way.
  - **E2E-encrypted** (`crypto.subtle`, key from the code): server stores
    only ciphertext, so merge (union hearts, last-write-wins settings,
    read-merge-write on push) is all client-side.
  - **Cost ≈ $0** on Cloudflare's free tier (blobs are KB; the debounce
    keeps writes far under the 1k/day cap); **$5/mo** soft floor only if it
    ever outgrows free. Opt-in, disposable (lose the code → mint a new one,
    re-seed), degrades to local-only offline.
  - Honest limit: **on-device at-rest encryption is the platform's job**
    (OS full-disk encryption) — a web app can't meaningfully encrypt its
    own `localStorage` against someone holding the unlocked device without
    prompting for the code every open. We won't overclaim it.
  - ⚑ v2 is the first standing backend — building it is the owner's go.
- **May subsume queued items** — revisit when v2 is scoped: per-device
  profiles (ADR 0012) gain a cross-device dimension; the "separate
  signed-in app owns sync" assumption (Theme 6) is retired; the shareable
  shortlist links overlap v1's codec. Audit before building so nothing's
  built twice.
- **Terminology (addendum 2, ADR 0017):** once passkey sync ships, **don't
  say "no accounts"** — a passkey reads as an account to users. State what
  we *don't* collect (no email/password/identity/tracking; E2E so only you
  can read it). Lockstep: revisit the About line (`about-ui.js`) in the same
  change that ships passkey sync — it's true today (no passkey yet).

## Theme 10 — Cross-person sharing (ongoing, revocable) — owner-gated

Considered 2026-07-23, **not yet decided**. Distinct from Theme 9 (a
person's *own* devices) and from the one-shot group-order links (ADR 0009,
a snapshot). Builds on Theme 9's E2E store; **needs its own ADR when built.**

The capability: person A grants person B **ongoing, read-only, revocable**
access to a **scoped slice** of their personal layer — e.g. Ruth shares her
favourites so the orderer can pick her usual when ordering for the family.

- **Scenario 1 (send picks to the family order) does *not* need this** —
  owner agreed 2026-07-23: ADR 0009's link already does the async "send my
  picks" job; live simultaneous *rooms* are a separate later polish, not a
  reason to build sharing. Don't build the backend for Scenario 1.
- **Why the backend earns its keep here (Scenario 2):** a v1 shareable-link
  of favourites is a **snapshot that goes stale**; "ongoing/live" forces the
  backend + a **pull** model. Additive — ADR 0009's link stays the
  zero-account floor.
- **Opt-in, per-scope** (owner steer 2026-07-23): the sharer chooses *what*
  they expose — **separate toggles for favourites / dietary needs /
  allergens**, not all-or-nothing. Read-only for the recipient; one-way
  (mutual = two grants); revoke must be easy and obvious.
- **Crypto step-up — E2E sharing is key-sharing.** The server can't "grant
  access" (it can't decrypt). Each user needs a **keypair**; the sharer wraps
  a copy of their data-key to the recipient's public key (envelope
  encryption). **Revocation is forward-only** — the recipient may have cached
  what they already saw; state that limit to users. → **Lean Theme 9 the
  right way: give each user a keypair from the start**, even though self-sync
  only needs the symmetric secret, so sharing is a smaller later step.
- ⚑ **Allergen-safety framing is load-bearing.** Shared dietary/allergen
  data is health-adjacent; ordering off a **stale or wrong** shared list is a
  **safety** failure, not cosmetic. Frame as **"informational — confirm with
  the person,"** never authoritative; inherit the app's existing allergen
  safety framing. Given real household allergies, non-negotiable.
- ⚑ **Two owner calls before building:**
  1. Should Faves share allergen/dietary data across people **at all**, or
     does that belong to the separate private health app (Theme 6)? Same
     "personal data leaves the safe zone" split that carved out Theme 6.
  2. Default scope granularity (favourites-only vs including dietary/allergens).

## Also parked (small)

✅ **Done** — **"Open now"** live status + filter (2026-07-08, ADR 0006);
**shareable group shortlist links** (2026-07-10, ADR 0009); the **te reo Māori**
UI toggle first pass (2026-07-09, `reo.js` — chrome only; safety text stays
English); and the pre-launch reo **wording review** (✅ ran 2026-07-22 — an AI
pass over all 68 strings). ⚠ **honest caveat:** the AI pass is **not** a
fluent-speaker sign-off — a native review of the 9 flagged strings stays the
**owner option** before public launch
([review](reviews/2026-07-22-1148-reo-wording-review.md)). Detail →

## Recommended sequence

By value-per-effort and dependency order:

1. **Coordinates + native-maps handoff** (S) — tiny, daily payoff,
   unblocks maps.
2. **Order tally** (M) — the flagship; turns *decided* into *ordered &
   reconciled*.
3. **Design pass** — sticky search, right-hand info panel, cart polish (M).
4. **Distance-sorted "what's close"** (M) — needs coords from step 1.
5. **Content growth + dish photos** — ongoing, in parallel throughout.
6. **Extended allergens** (S) → **curated/local ratings** (M) →
   **nutrition where owned** (L).
7. **Health app** — a separate project once the above have matured.

**Parallel, any time (Theme 7):** the zero-dependency CI guard is a cheap
pre-launch win; SBOM publishing can land alongside the Phase 7 deploy so
the live site ships with a provenance artifact from day one.

**Owner calls — resolved 2026-07-08:**
1. Order tally: **in** (shipped); STRATEGY non-goal clarification landed.
2. Ratings: **show the live number when online (edge-function proxy),
   link-out when offline; dish ratings curated** — see Theme 5.
3. Feedback intake: **no email; parked** — deploy first (Theme 4c).
4. SBOM: **CycloneDX JSON at `/.well-known/sbom.json`** — see Theme 7.
