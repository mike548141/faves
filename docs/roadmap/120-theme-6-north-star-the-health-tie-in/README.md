# Theme 6 — North star: the health tie-in

Treat this as a **separate, private, personal app that *consumes* Faves**
— not a feature bolted into Faves. Why the split is the right
architecture:

- Faves is public, account-free, and forbids personal/health data in the
  repo. An eating diary + exercise log is inherently personal, private
  and persistent — the opposite shape. Mixing them would drag exactly the
  data this repo bans into a public artefact.
- Clean seam: Faves *publishes* structured dish data (portions, tags,
  nutrition where known); a downstream personal app *logs* what was eaten
  against it. **The order tally (Theme 1) is the natural bridge** — an
  order history is the seed of an eating diary.
- Keep the boundary absolute: nothing personal enters this repo. The
  health app is its own project (local-first, private store) that reads
  Faves' JSON.

This stays a *direction*, not a phase — but Themes 1 and 5 are the hooks
that make it possible later, so building them "leaning the right way"
costs nothing now.
